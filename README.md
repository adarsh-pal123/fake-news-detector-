# Fake News Detector — Capstone Project

This repo contains a simple Fake News Detector using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression and a Gradio demo.

Files:
- train_model.py  : training script (run on Colab)
- utils.py        : text cleaning
- app.py          : Gradio web app
- model.pkl       : trained model (upload after training)
- vectorizer.pkl  : TF-IDF vectorizer (upload after training)

I will train the model using Google Colab and upload the saved model files here.
